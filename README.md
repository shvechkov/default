*Progressed from Staff SWE to Sr Architect to Product Owner to Technical Director*

#### Leadership & Strategy
- Provided hands-on technical leadership for AI/ML initiatives and platform modernization, reporting to CTO; Owned end-to-end lifecycle of three enterprise products (Replication & High Availability, OneXafe, CloudDirect, $15-17M revenue).  
- Led multiple high-impact teams of up to 10 engineers across storage, cloud protection, and AI-driven features, defining strategic roadmaps, architecting scalable solutions, and delivering on schedule with up to 40% reduced delivery cycles.  
- Mentored engineers while actively coding and prototyping, ensuring technical excellence and measurable customer impact.

#### AI/ML Integration & Agentic Systems
- Architected and prototyped malware/anomaly detection features: coded EDA pipelines, performed feature engineering, trained ML models, and fine-tuned LLMs using Python and C++.  
- Developed and optimized transformer-based masked LLMs via ONNX Runtime for edge inference, writing performance-critical C++ code.  
- Prototyped and coded agentic AI assistants using LangChain and OpenAI, integrating with legacy systems via REST, SOAP, and MCP protocols (RAG knowledgebase chat bots + agentic backend features – decreased support calls by 20%).  
- Designed and implemented an interactive RAG-based AI assistant, writing core logic and optimizing retrieval pipelines.  
- Architected and coded microservices (Model Context Protocol servers) to integrate AI-driven interfaces with legacy APIs.

#### Systems & Product Engineering
- Architected and coded core Arcserve features, including data deduplication, file system/server replication, high availability (HA), and agentless protection for AWS/Azure workloads (VMs, containers, storage), with hands-on contributions in C++ and Go.  
- Prototyped and developed a Linux-based immutable object-store server (cyber-resilient appliance), writing core components and reducing delivery cycle by 40%, enabling 6-month faster market entry.  
- Coded system and kernel-level components (file systems, filter drivers) on Windows and Linux for high-throughput backup and replication products.

#### R&D & Innovation
- Won hackathons for AI and infrastructure prototypes, rapidly coding proof-of-concepts in Rust and Python.  
- Led M&A-influencing projects, performing due diligence and coding prototypes to validate technical feasibility.  
- Developed kernel-mode anti-malware solutions and email archiving engines, contributing both architecture and implementation.

### Early Career
**Software Engineer / Principal Engineer**  
**Yandex, XOsoft, Computer Associates | 1998–2014**  
- Designed and coded high-traffic web applications and CDN modules at Yandex and XOsoft using C++ and Perl, optimizing search, advertising, and content delivery systems for performance and reliability.  
- Built high-availability data replication modules at XOsoft using C++ and led a team of 5 engineers, later architecting features like deduplication, full system protection, and cloud replication while developing file system drivers for Windows and Linux/Unix at CA to deliver scalable solutions.  
- Developed an end-to-end build automation system akin to Jenkins for Unix/Linux platforms, integrating a web UI for progress reporting, reducing manual labor by 40–50%, and streamlining QA and production processes.
